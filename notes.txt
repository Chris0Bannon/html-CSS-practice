html =hyper text mark up language.
CSS = cascading style sheets.

html is the architecture structure, the building blocks, the pillars and columns.
css is the wall paper, carpet and drapes.

Both are backwards compatible.  The spaceJam website still works.

you can check it out in the dev tools here.

Css works from the top down, thats what cascading means!

the goal of these two languages is too render content on a webpage
JavaScripts job is to play with that content.

browsers inherent jobs are to make sense of these languages.

a static webpage stay the same.  like the space jam site.
static webpages tend to have a lot of repeated code.


a dynamic webpage is a page that moves. 
much of the content is generated.

when you start a new webpage draw it out first.
