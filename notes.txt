html =hyper text mark up language.
CSS = cascading style sheets.

html is the architecture structure, the building blocks, the pillars and columns.
css is the wall paper, carpet and drapes.

Both are backwards compatible.  The spaceJam website still works.

you can check it out in the dev tools here.

Css works from the top down, thats what cascading means!

the goal of these two languages is too render content on a webpage
JavaScripts job is to play with that content.

browsers inherent jobs are to make sense of these languages.

a static webpage stay the same.  like the space jam site.
static webpages tend to have a lot of repeated code.


a dynamic webpage is a page that moves. 
much of the content is generated.

when you start a new webpage draw it out first.

in html an element is a section of the page, and the tag is name,
and container for it.  Some elements are self closing, but most will
need a second tag to end them.

elements can be nested within one another.  the span tag is nested in 
the body tag!  there is another span tag nested in the p tag, and that p 
tag is nested in a div tag.  that div is in the body.

browsers will try to render everything you give it.  Even if it is 
invalid.  

tables, lists, and dropdown menus can be complicated to use.  browsers
will attempt to render them, but often times will not be able to do it
predictably.

attributes are ways to alter elements.  Usually those are written with
an equals sign within a tag.  for example, id or class.

there are container elements in html.  we have used a div tag in our html
there are other styles of container, many of them are there for
accesibility. back in the day everything was a div!  now we can 
use header so that it is easy to tell wtf is going on.

what is contained int the alt"" quotes is used to describe things to someone
using a screen reader.

Some elements are called inline elements, they appear in the same line.
span button and input are the most common of these!

block level elements will take u pthe whole page and be the only thing on that line
headers, list items, divs, p tags, images

div is great if you want to place something as a block
and span is great if you want to place something inline
You can change anything by resetting its property in CSS


the entire internet used to run on tables but we have moved to divs!
head establishes coloumns, and the body establishes rows!  There are a lot 
tags involved in tables.  Have fun using them LOL
